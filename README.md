Acadgild Front End Web Development Fundamentals course, Session 1, HTML, All 4 Assignments

Session One of Acadgild's Front End Web Development Fundamentals was held on Friday, March 17, 2017. 
It covered the basics of how the internet works, HTML, and HTML5. It was mostly a review for me.

The four assignments are as follows:
1.1 Submit an HTML document that renders correctly, and that has at least one paragraph and two images.
1.2 Design an HTML page having body, head, and title tags.
1.3 Design an HTML page which uses subscript and superscript.
1.4 Design an HTML5 document that includes text insertion and text deletion examples.

Since these are very simple things, I have included all on one HTML document.
